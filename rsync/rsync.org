* Misc
- Probably several modes of operation
  - Daemon (TCP 873)
    - Writable
    - Readonly?
  - Client
  - xattr-enabled (Extended file attributes)
- Protocols
  - native rsync
  - RSH
  - SSH
- Replaces
  - rcp
  - scp

* Features
- Synchronization of files and directories
- Delta encoding to minimize data transfer
- Only one trasmission in each direction while mirroring
- Supports compression and recursion
- Scriptable
- Can update whole directory trees and filesystems
- Optionally preserves symbolic links, hard links, file ownership, permissions, devices and times
requires no special privileges to install
- Internal pipelining reduces latency for multiple files
- Can use rsh, ssh or direct sockets as the transport
- Supports anonymous rsync which is ideal for mirroring

* Metrics (by ohloh.net)
- Mostly written in C (~38k LoC)
- Mature, well-established codebase
- Small development team
- Decreasing year-over-year development activity
